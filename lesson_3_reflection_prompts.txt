When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    generally when I will be working from different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	because after every change git will automativcally update. It is very slow, inefficient process.
