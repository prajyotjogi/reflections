When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    generally when I will be working from different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	because after every change git will automativcally update. It is very slow, inefficient process.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks are like clones on the github, but unlike clones if we change something then it will not be seen in the original repository, while in clone it happens.
